# CHANGELOG.TXT

Added get/set on models for properties

* IMPORTANT - storage "get" and "getAll" have been renamed "fetch" and "fetchAll"

Added .storageAdapter() function on models to get the storage adapter to call functions on'

Added ._prepModel() - this is used for when retrieving values of a model and creating the object (like fetching from a storageAdapter)

Models can have a "validate" function that gets called when you call .set() on properties.  It will automatically check validation.  

.set() now has a third parameter (options)
   options.silent - don't display an error message
   options.error(model,message,errorFnc) - error function for validation callback. Your validation function can return true for success or a string which gets pased in as message

   ```
   .set("name","Joe",{silent:false,error:function(model,msg){console.log("alert "+msg);}})
