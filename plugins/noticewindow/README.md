# Notice window plugin for jqUi

###Author: Ian Maffett (appMobi)

This plugin gives "facebook" style notice windows (clicking on messages, notices, etc).

# Using the notice window plugin

1) Call $(container).noticeWindow({opts})



```js
 $(document.body).noticeWindow({
       title:'Notifications', //string
       content:'This is a sample', //string of thml
       arrowLeft:'middle' //left,middle,right or pixels from the left
   });

 ```
 
There are different configuration options you can pass in.  Please note, if jq.scroller.js is included, we will add a scroller to the content area

```js
containerCss:'' //CSS for the container class
title:'' //Title at the top
content:'' //Html content to show
arrowLeft:"5px"// Position from the left for the arrow.  Can also be left/middle/right
arrowDirection:"up" //Is the arrow at the top or bottom
```
