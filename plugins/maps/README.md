# Google Maps plugin using jqMobi

###Author: Ian Maffett (appMobi)

This plugin helps you create a google maps object on your page.  You can include the google maps script tag, or we can create it asyncronously.

```html
<script src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true"></script>
```

# Using

To use this, call .gmaps on a jqMobi collection and pass in options from the google maps API.  If you have not included the google maps script tag from above, we will add it for you.
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/

```js
$(document).ready(function(){
   $("#maps").gmaps({options});
});
```

#Retreiving the Google maps object

To get a google maps object that you can interact with, call the gmaps function with no parameters.  You must create the map before hand.

```js
var myMap=$("#maps").gmaps();
```

#Triggering a resize command

To trigger a resize  command

```js
$("#maps").gmaps('resize');
```

#Using in jqUi

If you are using this in jqUi, you need to trigger a resize when the panel is loaded.

```html
<div id="maps" title="Maps" class="panel" data-load="resizeMap">

</div>
```

```js
function resizeMap(){
    $("#maps").gmaps("resize");
}
```
