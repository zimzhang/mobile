# range slider plugin for jqMobi apps
###Author: Ian Maffett (appMobi)

This plugin is similar to the HTML5 range input, but works great on mobile devices

# Using the range slider plugin

1) Call $(container).range({opts})



```html
 <div id="slider2" class="slider"></div>
```

```js
$("#slider2").range({value:15});
```
 
There are different configuration options you can pass in.  Please note, if jq.scroller.js is included, we will add a scroller to the content area

```js
min:1, //Minimum value for the range slider
max:100, //Maximum value for the range slider
value:0, //initial starting value
rangeClass:"range", //CSS class for range div
pointerClass:"pointer", //CSS class for the bubble/circle on the range
sliderClass:"slider",//CSS class for the slider in general
rangeFillClass:"rangefill", //CSS class for the range as it gets filled
bubbleClass:"rangeBubble", //CSS class for the bubble that appears on top with the value  in it
stepFunc:function(){},//Function that gets executed every step when the range gets moved
```
